# React Application (Create React App)

This project was bootstrapped using Create React App, a popular toolchain for building React applications with zero configuration.

---

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (comes with Node.js)

---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.

- The page reloads automatically on code changes
- Lint errors appear in the console

---

### npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

---

### npm run build
Builds the app for production into the build folder.

- Optimized and minified
- Filenames include hashes
- Ready for deployment

---

### npm run eject
Warning: This is irreversible

Ejecting gives you full control over the configuration (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), but you lose the simplicity of Create React App.

You usually do not need to eject unless you require advanced customization.
